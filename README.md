# AdhesinLogicProject

## Simulation scripts are in scripts/
* 1D_interact.ipynb and 1D_no_interact.ipybn simulate two colonies in 1D that either have complementary adhesin pairs and form a visible interface, or don't have complementary adhesin pairs, and so don't form a visible interface. Shown in Fig. 2c and video S4.
* 2D_interact.ipynb and 2D_interact.ipynb simulate the same problem, but now in 2D. Shown in Fig. 2c and video S4.
* DifferentGrowthRates.ipynb simulates colonies that expand at different rates for Fig. 2g. 
* DifferentSeedingRatios.py is a script that simulates many different initial seeding ratios of colonies with complementary adhesin pairs, and saves an image of the final time point. Shown in Fig. 2i.
* Escher.ipynb simulates the Escher like transmutation pattern of Fig. 1e.
* UofA.ipynb simulates the U of A pattern of Fig XX
* Voronoi.ipynb simulates the Voronoi seeding pattern of Fig. XX
